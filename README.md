# Acne Reset – Vite + React + Tailwind starter

This is a zero-config starter. After unzipping:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## What’s inside
- Vite + React 18
- Tailwind CSS (via PostCSS)
- framer-motion + lucide-react
- Your uploaded component lives in `src/App.jsx`

## Notes
- Replace any placeholder checkout/community URLs in the UI as needed.
- The app mocks `/seats.json` in the browser so it runs without a backend.
